##Notes about the API layout
On all the pages, the heading level 1 item is the name of the module and the heading level 2 items are the classes. Heading level 3 items are for the methods/functions inside the class.  
Under each class title there is a brief description, then the class call with arguments and defaults.  
Under the call there is a list of arguments and their descriptions. If an argument is a dict, the keys will be shown like `['key']`. This is what one would do to call the key from the dict.  
After the arguments, there is a table showing the full path of the class method/function and a basic description.  
Under that there is the method/function name at heading level 3. There will be an example of the function and it's arguments and defaults. After the function there is a -> and the items that function returns if any.
