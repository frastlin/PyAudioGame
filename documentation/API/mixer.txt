#pyaudiogame.mixer
The main module for handling sound playback.
Currently the mixer is taken strait from:  
[pygame's mixer module](http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.get_num_channels)  
Their documentation is much better than mine, so if you wish to learn how sound works, read their documentation.  
\*note\*
if you wish to play music, you need to use the mixer.music module. read:  
[The music tutorial](http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html)

##cheetsheet
To create a sound create it using:  
mySound = Sound("filename")  
to play it do:  
mySound.play()  

To pan the sound create a Channel object by doing:  
myChannel = Channel(1)  
Then add the sound to the channel like:  
myChannel.play(mySound)  
Then set the panning by doing  
`myChannel.set_channel(0, 1)`  
The first number is left and the second number is right. the numbers are from 0 to 1. If there is just the first number, the sound will be full on both speakers.  
<br/>  
to load a song to the music module type:  
mixer.music.load("filename")  
to play it type:  
mixer.music.play()
