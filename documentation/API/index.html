<h2>Notes about the API layout</h2>

<p>On all the pages, the heading level 1 item is the name of the module and the heading level 2 items are the classes. Heading level 3 items are for the methods/functions inside the class. <br />
Under each class title there is a brief description, then the class call with arguments and defaults. <br />
Under the call there is a list of arguments and their descriptions. If an argument is a dict, the keys will be shown like <code>['key']</code>. This is what one would do to call the key from the dict. <br />
After the arguments, there is a table showing the full path of the class method/function and a basic description. <br />
Under that there is the method/function name at heading level 3. There will be an example of the function and it's arguments and defaults. After the function there is a -> and the items that function returns if any.</p>
