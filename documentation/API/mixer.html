<h1>pyaudiogame.mixer</h1>

<p>The main module for handling sound playback.
Currently the mixer is taken strait from: <br />
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mixer.html#pygame.mixer.get_num_channels">pygame's mixer module</a> <br />
Their documentation is much better than mine, so if you wish to learn how sound works, read their documentation. <br />
*note*
if you wish to play music, you need to use the mixer.music module. read: <br />
<a href="http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/music.html">The music tutorial</a></p>

<h2>cheetsheet</h2>

<p>To create a sound create it using: <br />
mySound = Sound("filename") <br />
to play it do: <br />
mySound.play()  </p>

<p>To pan the sound create a Channel object by doing: <br />
myChannel = Channel(1) <br />
Then add the sound to the channel like: <br />
myChannel.play(mySound) <br />
Then set the panning by doing <br />
<code>myChannel.set_channel(0, 1)</code> <br />
The first number is left and the second number is right. the numbers are from 0 to 1. If there is just the first number, the sound will be full on both speakers. <br />
<br/> <br />
to load a song to the music module type: <br />
mixer.music.load("filename") <br />
to play it type: <br />
mixer.music.play()    </p>
