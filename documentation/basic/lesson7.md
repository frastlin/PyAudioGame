#So what does this mean?
This means that you have enough knowledge to make a simple game!  
You can create stats by assigning numbers to variables, you can put those variables in storage, you can import random to make your game more interesting, you can create functions to run if statements to check if variables are something and you can speak text.  
#How to create a game
There are two aproaches programmers use to make a game or an app, there is something called "bottom up" and "top down".  
Bottom up is when a programmer has a piece of code they wish to get working and they get that one piece of code working, then create a game around that.  
Top down is where a programmer sits down and writes out everything they would like to have in their app, then makes an outline for their game.  
For new programmers, top down is what works best.  
##first step
I'm sure you have some ideas of what games to write, and if you don't, just make something that has to do with monkies and or penguins who wish to take over the world. You can't go wrong there.  
Once you have an idea, write a paragraph describing the game.
