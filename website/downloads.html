<p>Please <br />
<a href="https://github.com/frastlin/PyAudioGame/releases/download/v0.04full/release.zip">Download</a> <br />
The latest windows release and unzip it to a folder of your choice with a tool like
<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7 zip.</a>
Then follow the instructions in the file called GettingStarted.html. <br />
alternatively, if you already use python, 
<a href="https://github.com/frastlin/PyAudioGame/">visit the github page for just the python package</a> <br />
*note* If downloading the windows release, you do not need python, it comes in the zip file. <br />
The package works with both python 2.x and 3.x. The windows release is in 2.7 though.</p>
